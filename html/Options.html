<h2><u>Options</u></h2>

<p>All of the below options can be specified as command line options.</p>

<p>The same options are used in configuration files by removing the leading
'-', and adding a following '=' if a parameter is included. (i.e <code>-model
1</code> becomes <code>model=1</code>).</p>

<p>Also on the command line, any command line arguments ending in
<code>.t8c</code> will be assumed to be a configuration file, and those
options will be loaded before startup of the emulator. Any command line
arguments ending in <code>.t8s</code> will be assumed to be a state file,
and that state will be restored upon startup of the emulator. A command line
argument ending in <code>.cmd</code> will be assumed to be a CMD file and
will be executed upon startup of the emulator.</p>

    <td><code>-cassdir dir</code></td>
    <td>Specify the directory containing cassette and stringy wafer images.
        Default is the current directory.</td>

              -charset3 name<br>
              -charset4 name</code></td>
    <td>Select among several sets of built-in character bitmaps.
        The three different options allow you to specify the character
        set used for each model, should you change models during SDLTRS
        execution using the GUI. In Model I mode (<code>-charset1</code>),
        seven sets are available. The default, <code>wider</code>, is a
        modified Model III set with characters 8 pixels wide; it looks better
        on a modern computer screen with square pixels than the real Model I
        fonts, which were 6 pixels wide. <code>lcmod</code> is the character
        set in the replacement character generator that was supplied with the
        Radio Shack lower case modification. (It was reconstructed partly from
        memory and may have some minor bit errors.) <code>stock</code> is the
        character set in the stock character generator supplied with most upper
        case only machines. Since SDLTRS currently always emulates the extra
        bit of display memory needed to support lower case, this character set
        gives you the authentic, unpleasant effect that real Model I users saw
        when they tried to do homebrew lower case modifications without
        replacing the character generator: lower case letters appear at an
        inconsistent height, and if you are using the Level II BASIC ROM
        display driver, upper case letters are replaced by meaningless symbols.
        <code>early</code> is the same as <code>stock</code>, but with the
        standard ASCII characters [, \, ], and ^ in the positions where most
        Model I's had directional arrows. This was the default programming in
        the Motorola character generator ROM that Radio Shack used, and a few
        early machines were actually shipped with this ROM. <code>genie</code>
        or <code>german</code> gives an emulation of the Genie I/II (relabled
        Video Genie in Germany) with german characters. <code>ht-1080z</code>
        or <code>hungarian</code> emulates the HT-1080Z (relabled Video Genie in
        Hungary) with accented hungarian characters. <code>videogenie</code>
        displays the character set of the EACA Video Genie (also labeled as the
        System 80 in Australia/New Zealand and PMC-80/81 in North America).<br>
        In Model III (<code>-charset3</code>), 4 and 4P (<code>-charset4</code>)
        modes, three sets are available: <code>katakana</code> (the default for
        Model III) is the original Model III set with Japanese Katakana
        characters in the alternate character positions. This set was also used
        in early Model 4's. <code>international</code> (the default for Model 4
        and 4P) is a later Model 4 set with accented Roman letters in the
        alternate positions. <code>bold</code> is a bold set from a character
        generator ROM found in one Model III, origin uncertain.
        The name of the character set may be abbreviated to one character.</td>

        Whenever the Z80 program reads the keyboard matrix and sees an emulated
        key go up or down, SDLTRS waits cycles Z80 clock cycles (T-states)
        before it allows the program to see another key transition.
        Key transitions that are received during the waiting period or when the
        Z80 program is not reading the keyboard are held in a queue.

    <td>Set the sense switches on the Model I serial port card.
        This option is meaningful only in Model I mode, and only when the
        <code>-serial</code> option is not set to "". The default value is
        <code>0x6f</code>, which Radio Shack software conventionally
        interprets as 9600 bps, 8 bits/word, no parity, 1 stop bit.</td>

    <td>Turn off the single density data address mark remapping kludges
        described in the "Emulated floppy disks" and "Real floppy disks"
        sections above. With this option given, the distinction between
        F8 and FA data address marks is strictly observed on both writing and
        reading. This option is probably not useful unless you need to deal
        with Model I disks that use the distinction as part of a copy-
        protection scheme. See also "Common File Formats for Emulated TRS-80
        Floppy Disks", available at http://www.tim-mann.org/trs80/dskspec.html.
