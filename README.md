Thanks to TÃ©rcio Martins a package for Arch Linux is available in the [AUR].

## SDL2

The [SDL2] branch contains the SDL2 version with hardware rendering support.
Although considered as *experimental*, it is recommended for newer systems
(SDL2 binaries and packages above are build on the *master* branch, which
uses software rendering).

The SDL2 version is available in [RetroPie] since version 4.6.6 and Valerio
Lupi's fork of [RetroPie-Setup] ...
